# printers-kickoff
Idea sources here:
* http://www.yegor256.com/2016/04/05/printers-instead-of-getters.html
* http://www.yegor256.com/2015/03/26/jaxb-vs-xembly.html

The short-term idea is done, synthesising both ideas given by Yegor Bugayenko at his [blog](http://www.yegor256.com) and thereby getting a proof-of-concept how to avoid the getter-mess with both json- and xml-printers.

The long-term idea is to also replace DTO-usage when transferring json.
